Root:
	Implement the received packet callback such that it:
		Records the energy/time information
		Resets the values so that a new recording may start
			-- Doing it this way means we need to discard first measurement (since root might have been running before leaf, adding noise to measurements - especially if left on for a while)

Leaf:
	Implement packet send when associated, allowing root to also reset its power values.
		-- In send callback (if status == 0), record data and reset our values/interfaces
		-- If status != 0, probably output some warning message indicating result isn't great then re-send the packet.
Both:
	Implement varying of EB period and channel hopping sequence 
		Shorter EB period will increase root power use and decrease connection time (in theory)
		Shorter (fewer channels) channel hopping sequence will decrease connection time, not sure what it will do to energy use
			-- Probably in noisy environments, this reduces performance? Might need to verify this.


Then gather data and write the paper text. Not much code complexity in this one, but data gathering requires extensive test runtime.
