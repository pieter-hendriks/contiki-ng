	TX power @ 0 dBm -> 33.04 mA while CPU active, 29.01 mA while CPU sleeping. 

	--> In our case I guess CPU is generally active, but unsure.
	--> Definitely need to compare to numbers we have, also might be worth incorporating into other results


TODO:
	2:
		Analyse join process
	
	3:
		Mention what height the nodes are at
		Use assignment distances (obv)
		Use legend in TSCH schedule graph
		Fix figure references
		Fix underscore stuff @ ENERGEST_CONF_ON itemize
		Capitalize TX/RX every time
		Consistent packet size pls
			Also avoid 'out of convenience' packet size & 'because it's a nice, round number'
		Move unchanged 1 to 5 meters stuff into resutls
		Capitalize section titles
		Higher TX power == higher power use observation must be supported, see paper above.
		
		Do range capabilities experiment 
			--> Do multiple, repeated runs for clear data
			--> Aggregate less - present results per distance, not just overall.	
		Re-write text, correct spelling mistakes
		Handle comments from review 2
