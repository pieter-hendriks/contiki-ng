- Ensure packets are actually sent on the planned slot.
- Split the code for each into seperate headers, and include based on MYAPP_AS_COORDINATOR
		- Code will be a lot cleaner, the amount of #ifdef in current setup makes it hard to follow.

Network time -> Done. We have ticks and reference value ticks and us for slot, so can convert.
PHY retransmit = Done. 
Packet drops also recorded by 0s in root node
All distances TBD
Graphing + output + improved text = TODO


IMPLEMENTED:
  Use network time to determine latencies.
      --> in ms
  Use PHY retransmits instead of mac arrivals (more precise)
  Use various TX powers

TEXT/GRAPH STUFF:
  Improve graphs once data collected -> Improve output to create better format
  Add TSCH schedule graph
  Indicate run-to-run variance/margin of error if using it in text
  Include conclusions.

TODO:
	Handle comments on my work. 
    Test on all distances

	  
	
  Other sections:
    Then add throughput evaluation section.
    Improve related works.
    Better explain underlying stuff - relevant TSCH characteristics should be briefly explained, then reference to standard or smthng
    Better explain reason behind study - Mention why what we're studying is interesting, rather than only do because assignment. 
    Explain methodology (Topology, traffic, scheduling, netstack, ...)
    Compare with other configurations, vary one parameter at a time.
